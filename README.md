Odin project: Landing Page

Foundations
PROJECT: LANDING PAGE

I learned html and css basics, this is the final project in html-css foundations.

The design I get comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the entire website and one
has some details about some of the fonts and colors we have used.
